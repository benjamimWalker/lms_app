# Lms app

This repository is based on Faraday Academy's [Fast API LMS](https://github.com/faraday-academy/fast-api-lms)
I used their [turorial](https://youtu.be/gQTRsZpR7Gw) when I was learning Fast API and I wanted to use its idea for my own project.

I tried to bring all the features from the original final repository, considering that the original doesn't have all the features it should have.

I used GraphQL instead of just REST as the original tutorial.

This small project is just for learning purposes, and record my progress in learning Fast API and GraphQL.
